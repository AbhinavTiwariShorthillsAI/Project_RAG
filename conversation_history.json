    "question": "Tell me about occupied czechoslovakia",
    "answer": "Following the annexation of the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia was left weak and unable to resist further occupation. In March 1939, the rest of Czechoslovakia was broken up. Germany occupied the Sudetenland, Hungary took part of Slovakia (including Carpathian Ruthenia), and Poland annexed Trans-Olza. On March 15, 1939, the German Wehrmacht occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia. Hitler proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia to be the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia from Prague Castle, completing the German occupation. Slovakia separated and became a German satellite state. During the occupation, between 294,000 and 320,000 citizens were affected. The Czechoslovak president, Emil H\u00e1cha, was coerced into signing away his country's independence and was left as a nominal, powerless State President while real power was vested in Hitler's representative, the Reichsprotektor.\n"
